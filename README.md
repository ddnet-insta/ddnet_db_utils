# ddnet_db_utils

Helper methods that extend ddnet's database code.
This is not a proper library just a piece of code.
It has to be plugged into a ddnet code base as if it was
a regular source file. Otherwise it does not compile.

## who is this for

This is unlikely useful for you. It only works with
very specific ddnet code base versions.
This repo is strictly tied to ddnet-insta and will always
support its latest version.
